Enrollment School System
Subjects, Students, and Enrollment Record. since this is modular, you can easily add new features

1. using PysimpleGUI to create windows for each module
2. Using Dictionary to store the data
3. Using JSON conversion from dictionary to store as a text file with .json extension
4. passing parameters as an object dictionary instead of fields to easily get the data into the memory.
5. Feel free to add OS.PATH Commands to check for existing files.
